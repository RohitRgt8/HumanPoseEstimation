# Human Pose Estimation

- A basic model of Human Pose Estimation.
- A Machine Learning Model that predicts exercise poses from 15 different exercises.
- Predicts poses of both images and videos given as input.
- Global datasets were not used and a new dataset was created.



## Features

- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Model having 2 convolutional layers, 2 max-pooling layers and a fully-connected layer.
- Model trained using PyTorch
- A Web Interface for the application built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript.
- A Python Flask Server for communication with the trained model.
